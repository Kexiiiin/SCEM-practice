# The sample mode is the value which occurs with the highest frequency for a feature

## Estimates of location for continuous data
# Letâ€™s look at rainfall data for San Martino for the first 100 days of 1985 using the hydroTSM library
data(SanMartinoPPts)
rainfall <- as.vector(window(SanMartinoPPts, start = as.Date("1985-01-01"), end = as.Date("1985-01-01") + 99))

## The sample mean
# The most well known estimate of location is the sample mean (the arithmetic mean)
mean(rainfall, na.rm = TRUE)

## The sample median
# The sample median is the middle value after sorting the values by numerical order
median(rainfall, na.rm = TRUE)

## Outliers
# An outlier is a value in a data set which differs substantially from other values.

## Robustness of the sample median
# A major advantage of the median over the mean is that it is robust to small corruptions in the data set.

## The trimmed sample mean
# The trimmed sample mean is the mean computed after removing a prescribed fraction of the data. 
mean(rainfall, na.rm = TRUE, trim = 0.05)
