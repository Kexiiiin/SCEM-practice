## Example of R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## A Simple Function
First we create a simple function

```{r function}
f <- function(z){ return(5 * z ^ 2 + z + cos(15 * z) + 0.3 * sin(300 * z)) }
```

Then we randomly gnerate some x and set y to be f applied to x
```{r random generate x and set y}
x <- runif(100)
y <- f(x)
```

## Including Plots
we then put x and y together in a data frame df <- data.frame(x, y)
```{r x_and_y, echo=FALSE}
plot(x, y)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
